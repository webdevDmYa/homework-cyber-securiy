App,CVE,Score,Severity,Description
Discord,CVE-2020-15140,8.2,HIGH,"In Red Discord Bot before version 3.3.11, a RCE exploit has been discovered in the Trivia module: this exploit allows Discord users with specifically crafted usernames to inject code into the Trivia module's leaderboard command. By abusing this exploit, it's possible to perform destructive actions and/or access sensitive information. This critical exploit has been fixed on version 3.3.11."
Discord,CVE-2020-15147,8.5,HIGH,"Red Discord Bot before versions 3.3.12 and 3.4 has a Remote Code Execution vulnerability in the Streams module. This exploit allows Discord users with specifically crafted ""going live"" messages to inject code into the Streams module's going live message. By abusing this exploit, it's possible to perform destructive actions and/or access sensitive information. As a workaround, unloading the Trivia module with `unload streams` can render this exploit not accessible. It is highly recommended updating to 3.3.12 or 3.4 to completely patch this issue."
Discord,CVE-2020-15172,8.7,HIGH,"The Act module for Red Discord Bot before commit 6b9f3b86 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution. With this exploit, Discord users can use specially crafted messages to perform destructive actions and/or access sensitive information. Unloading the Act module with `unload act` can render this exploit inaccessible."
Discord,CVE-2021-26918,9.8,CRITICAL,"The ProBot bot through 2021-02-08 for Discord might allow attackers to interfere with the intended purpose of the ""Send an image when a user joins the server"" feature (or possibly have unspecified other impact) because the uploader web service allows double extensions (such as .html.jpg) with the text/html content type. NOTE: there may not be cases in which an uploader web service is customer controlled; however, the nature of the issue has substantial interaction with customer controlled configuration. NOTE: the vendor states ""This is just an uploader (like any other one) which uploads files to cloud storage and accepts various file types. There is no kind of vulnerability and it won't compromise either the client side or the server side."
Discord,CVE-2021-21433,9.9,CRITICAL,Discord Recon Server is a bot that allows you to do your reconnaissance process from your Discord. Remote code execution in version 0.0.1 would allow remote users to execute commands on the server resulting in serious issues. This flaw is patched in 0.0.2.
Discord,CVE-2021-29461,8.1,HIGH,"Discord Recon Server is a bot that allows one to do one's reconnaissance process from one's Discord. A vulnerability in Discord Recon Server prior to 0.0.3 could be exploited to read internal files from the system and write files into the system resulting in remote code execution. This issue has been fixed in version 0.0.3. As a workaround, one may copy the code from `assets/CommandInjection.py` in the Discord Recon Server code repository and overwrite vulnerable code from one's own Discord Recon Server implementation with code that contains the patch."
Signal,CVE-2000-0747,10.0,CRITICAL,The logrotate script for OpenLDAP before 1.2.11 in Conectiva Linux sends an improper signal to the kernel log daemon (klogd) and kills it.
Telegram,CVE-2017-17715,8.8,HIGH,"The saveFile method in MediaController.java in the Telegram Messenger application before 2017-12-08 for Android allows directory traversal via a pathname obtained in a file-transfer request from a remote peer, as demonstrated by writing to tgnet.dat or tgnet.dat.bak."
Telegram,CVE-2018-17613,9.8,CRITICAL,"Telegram Desktop (aka tdesktop) 1.3.16 alpha, when ""Use proxy"" is enabled, sends credentials and application data in cleartext over the SOCKS5 protocol."
Telegram,CVE-2018-20436,8.1,HIGH,"The ""secret chat"" feature in Telegram 4.9.1 for Android has a ""side channel"" in which Telegram servers send GET requests for URLs typed while composing a chat message, before that chat message is sent. There are also GET requests to other URLs on the same web server. This also affects one or more other Telegram products, such as Telegram Web-version 0.7.0. In addition, it can be interpreted as an SSRF issue. NOTE: a third party has reported that potentially unwanted behavior is caused by misconfiguration of the ""Secret chats > Preview links"" setting"
Telegram,CVE-2019-10044,8.8,HIGH,"Telegram Desktop before 1.5.12 on Windows, and the Telegram applications for Android, iOS, and Linux, is vulnerable to an IDN homograph attack when displaying messages containing URLs. This occurs because the application produces a clickable link even if (for example) Latin and Cyrillic characters exist in the same domain name, and the available font has an identical representation of characters from different alphabets."
